        <p align="justify">The 1st ACM Workshop on Wireless and Mobile Computing for AgeTech (MobiCom4AgeTech) will bring together academic researchers, industry leaders, and government partners to present research and discuss challenges and opportunities at the intersection of wireless and mobile computing, AI and data analytics, and technologies for supporting aging. The workshop will include keynote presentations from aging research experts, contributed paper presentations and demos, panel discussions, and presentations from research funders and commercialization partners. </p>

        <p align="justify">By 2060, it is estimated that nearly a quarter of the US population (over 95 million people) will be over the age of 65 and most will have multiple chronic conditions including cognitive impairment or dementia. The wireless and mobile computing research community has the potential to play a central role in the development of monitoring, assistive and interventional technologies for supporting healthy aging, an emerging area referred to as AgeTech. However, significant technology development challenges exist. </p>

        <p align="justify"><b>TOPICS:</b> The workshop is seeking research papers, extended abstracts, and demo proposals that describe technologies and approaches that can be brought to bear on challenges in the AgeTech space, as well as papers that highlight novel challenges or gaps with existing technologies. Technologies, challenges, and AgeTech applications of interest include (but are not limited to) the following:</p>
